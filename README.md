# AIGS Spring Server

The AI Game Server (AIGS) is a server that supports one or more games, and provides AI players to play against human opponents. In the basic version, only TicTacToe is implemented. However, game modules can easily be added. Student projects can either add new game modules or create clients for existing games.
